chicken fortress 3 code is annoying to work with ( nothing really wrong with the code but its so outdated that it just pisses me off )

this may or may not be my own tf2 port, depending on how much time i have and whether or not i will get bored LOL

feel free to help :)

## Timeline / Plans:
  ### Make the classes functional<br/>
    - Soldier -- BASICALLY DONE
      - the basic class stuff + both of his weapons are already in hl ( rpg, shotgun, melee with some changes )
    - Scout -- BASICALLY DONE
      - all hitscan, weapons are already in hl ( pistol ) or made when Soldier was worked on ( shotgun, melee )
      - double jumping!!!
    - Engineer ( no buildings ) -- BASICALLY DONE
      - all hitscan, literally just copy stuff from Scout & Soldier, mechanics are reserved for later
    - Spy ( no cloak / disguise ) -- BASICALLY DONE
      - all hitscan, knife mechanic is not hard to do, mechanics reserved for l8r
      - client based icons ( crit icon ) due to backstabs forcing crits
    - Heavy
      - TFConditions will appear, besides that hes easy to do
    - Sniper
      - copy code from heavy minigun slowdown, headshot damage / zoom in / laser spot is already in hl ( magnum revolver / crossbow / rpg laser ), crit icon stuff is already done
    - Pyro
      - TFCondition and afterburn things
      - AIRBLAST SHIT X_X
      - they should be easy to do anyway ( projectiles done on soldier )
    - Demoman
      - arcing projectiles already in hl ( grenades ) -- DONE
      - stickybomb things
    - Cloaking & Disguises
      - Networking the stuff will be more annoying
    - Medic
      - NETWORKED HEALING AND UBERCHARGE
      - everything else is fine ( syringes just projectiles )
    - Engineer buildings
      - seperate entities that have a bunch of properties, their own damage stuff, and needs to be networked to all clients constantly :))))
      - ugh
      - this probably wont be as annoying as i am making it seem
      - however, it is still saved for last
      - sorry not sorry!!!
  ### Class selection stuff<br/>
    - Commands are done, but there is no menu for it!! only commands right now
  ### Team selection stuff<br/>
    - Commands are done, but there is no menu for it!! only commands right now
  ### Gamemodes<br/>
    - Control Points
      - this is for compatibility with existing Chicken Fortress 3 maps
      - Medieval Mode
        - just force melee when a specific entity is present in the map
      - King of The Hill
        - Arena Mode ( literally just disable respawns here LMAO )
      - Attack / Defense
    - Capture The Flag
    - Payload
    - Zombie Infection
      - this is just to bait counter strike players into playing this LOLOLOL
   ### 9-way animation blending <br/>
    - This is primarily so it is easier to port the TF2 models directly over to this. 
    - This may not be needed.
